What the project does:
    This Homework #6 loads up an array of movie topics Sharon is interested in:
                   Sunrise, sunset, tropical storms, storm chasers, flooding, 
    Each topic generates a button with the topic name. 

    A form is used to take the value from the user input box. The input is added
        into the`topics` array and a function call takes each topic in the array and adds
        a button on the page.
    When the user clicks on a button, the page pulss in 10 static, non-animatede gif images 
        from the GIPHY API and place them on the page along with a  rating (PG, G, ...).
    When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user
         clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

Why the project is useful:
    This project is useful taking user input, finding the resources, then adding clickable
    links to facilitate ease of access --- a very common requirement from users.

How users can get started with the project

    load a max of 10 giphys based on that interests.  If you would like to add new buttons with
    user entered topics of interest, ty[e in your "interest", and click submit. If you would like
    to watch any of the giphs displayed, click on the the image of your choice. If the giphy is
    playing, click to pause.
