What the project does:
    This Homework #6 loads up an array of .gif topics Sharon is interested in:
                   Sunrise, sunset, tropical storms, storm chasers, flooding, 
    Each topic generates a button with the topic name. 

    A form is used to take a topic name from the user input box. The input is added
        into the`topics` array and a function call takes each topic in the array and adds
        a button with that topic name onto the page.
    When the user clicks on a topic button, the page pulls in 10 static, non-animated .gif images 
        from the GIPHY API and places them on the page along with a  rating (PG, G, ...).
    When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user
         clicks the gif again, it stops playing, it toggles.

Why the project is useful:
    This project is useful taking user input from the browser screen, finding the .gif resources, then adding clickable
    links to facilitate ease of access --- a very common requirement from users.

How users can get started with the project
    The screen will display a group of buttons with movie topic interests. Cick on a chosen button to 
    a max of 10 .gifs of that topic. 
    If you would like to add new topic buttons with user entered topics of interest, type in your
    "interest", and click submit. If you would like to watch any of the .gifs displayed, click on
    the the image of your choice. If the .gif is playing, click to pause, and toggle back and forth.
