    This Homework #6 loads up an array of movie topics Sharon is interested in:
                   Sunrise, sunset, tropical storms, storm chasers, flooding, 
    Each topic generates a button with the topic name. 

    A form is used to take the value from the user input box. The input is added
        into the`topics` array and a function call takes each topic in the array and adds
        a button on the page.
    When the user clicks on a button, the page pulss in 10 static, non-animatede gif images 
        from the GIPHY API and place them on the page along with a  rating (PG, G, ...).
    When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user
         clicks the gif again, it stops playing.
